# Backbone - React - Table

## Goals

* Learn how to use React, Facebook's "new" view/rendering framework.
* Learn how to integrate Backbone with React, essentially replacing Backbone.View with React.
* See how easy it is to render large table with React, adding in some behaviours (TBC).

## Offline JSX compiling

```sh
npm install -g react-tools
```

To compile JSX into JS:

```sh
jsx --watch src/ build/
```
